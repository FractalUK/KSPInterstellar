KSP Instellar Mod for Kerbal Space Program

This version of interstellar is modified and published by me, WaveFunctionP. It is not published by FractalUK, the creator of Interstellar. Do not blame him for broke things with this version, instead contact me here on github, the interstellar forum thread, forum pm/email or twitter: @wavefunctionp.


Review the change log on the dev branch for the most recent list of changes.


Installation instructions:



For players:

Download the compiled addon here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3im5o8t4ahxnyx7/oO9MQ45um7/KSPInterstellar



For developers:

The zip should work out pretty much out of the box. You may need to update the unity and c# library references for the FNPlugin and OpenResourceSystem solutions. And maybe your output paths. All assets for the plugin are included as linked references from the addon folders in the project, so they shouldn't copy. You may want to copy my gitignore to your repo as well.

I have no idea how it will work when pulling from my repo. I had to do a lot of house keeping to get a clean and workable repo with visual studio.
