description = An even larger Brayton cycle engine that turns thermal power into electrical power. The KTEC upgrade increases thermal effeciency to a max of 60%. Direct Drive mode has an effeciency of 85%, but only operates on charged parcticles. This part must be directly attached to a Reactor or Thermal reciever to function. You can attach two generators, one in each mode, to a reactor that generates both thermal energy and charged particles. Generators work best when matched with the same sized reactor, or suffer a penalty.
