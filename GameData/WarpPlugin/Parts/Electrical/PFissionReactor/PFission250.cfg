title = 2.5m "Sethlans 2" Fission Reactor
manufacturer = Kerbin Electric Inc.
description = Part of a new series of fission reactors with slightly different capabilities.  The "Sethlans" series reactor operates in unupgraded form as a Particle Bed reactor, which operates up to potentially higher themperatures than Molten Salt designs but has a power output that is inversely related to temperature.  Once upgraded, the reactor is a Dusty Plasma design capable of producing a high proportion of its power as charged particles.
