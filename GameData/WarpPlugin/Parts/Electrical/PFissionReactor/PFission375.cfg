title = 3.75m "Akula" Fission Reactor
manufacturer = Kerbin Electric Inc.
description = Part of a new series of fission reactors with slightly different capabilities.  The flagship "Akula" reactor provides tremendous power output, operating in unupgraded form as a Particle Bed reactor, which operates up to potentially higher themperatures than Molten Salt designs but has a power output that is inversely related to temperature.  Once upgraded, the reactor is a Dusty Plasma design capable of producing a high proportion of its power as charged particles.
