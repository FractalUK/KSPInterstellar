title = Antimatter Initiated Fusion Reactor Mk3
manufacturer = Geomax Plc.
description = An Antimatter Initated Fission/Fusion Reactor, it uses small quantities of antiprotons to produce fission in Uranium nuclei which in turn provide the energy to ignite fusion in a Deuterium/Helium-3 pellet.  The reactor contains the antiprotons magnetically and electrostatically in a vacuum.  This requires fewer bulky components compared to Tokomak designs but does require a healthy supply of antimatter to operate for long periods.
