title = Microwave Beamed Power Receiver
manufacturer = Ionic Protonic Electronics
description = Receives microwave energy beamed by a microwave phased array set to relay or tranmission mode. It's small collection area makes it optimal for small craft, provided that large distances aren't involved. To recieve power you must point the reciever towards a tranmitter or relay that is not blocked by a celestial body.
