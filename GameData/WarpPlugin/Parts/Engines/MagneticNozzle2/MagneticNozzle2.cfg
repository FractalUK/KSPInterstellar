manufacturer = Ionic Protonic Electronics
description = The Magnetic Nozzle is an advanced alternative to the thermal rocket which can expel high temperature charged exhaust at extremely high velocities  because the propellant is confined electromagnetically instead of physically.  It does require electric power and, of of course, only operates off reactors that generate charged particles. Not rated for atmospheric use.
