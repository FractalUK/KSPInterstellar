description = Primarily an Infrared telescope, capable of operating down into the orange colour range of the visible spectrum.  It can be used to perform deep field observations to study the early universe, imaging of planets within the Kerbin system, etc.  Most interestingly, if deployed in a stable orbit at >550 AU, it can be used using Kerbol as a gravitional lens to directly image nearby extra kerbolar-planets.  Who knows, perhaps there are more Kerbin-like worlds in the universe?
