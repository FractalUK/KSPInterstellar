1.7.10, 2015-11-10
- Updated for KSP 1.0.5.
- Disabled KSP compatibility check for the time being.

1.7.9, 2015-05-02
- Updated for KSP 1.0.2.

1.7.8, 2014-12-22
- Updated for KSP 0.90.0.

1.7.7, 2014-10-09
- Fixed a bug in the KSP compatibility check.

1.7.6, 2014-07-26
- In addition to the automatic update check, the plugin now also gets KSP versions
  from the update check server. In case the currently running KSP version is one of
  those versions, the plugin will not complain about being incompatible with this
  KSP version. This saves both players' and plugin authors' time.
- Updated for KSP 0.24.2.

1.7.5, 2014-07-25
- Updated for KSP 0.24.1.

1.7.4, 2014-07-17
- Updated for KSP 0.24.0.

1.7.3, 2014-06-26
- Improved positioning of folders and "drawables." This also fixes a bug that
  occurred if a folder/drawable was blocking both the nav ball and the altimeter
  at the same time.

1.7.2, 2014-06-22
- Folders and "drawables" (which are provided by third-party plugins) are now
  prevented from blocking the nav ball and altimeter.
- Folders and "drawables" will now open in the same spot as they opened the
  last time (as long as they fit on screen.) This should be helpful for third-
  party plugin developers that provide "drawables" that may change their size
  while being displayed.

1.7.1, 2014-04-02
- Updated for KSP 0.23.5.

1.7.0, 2014-03-03
- Fixed a bug that could prevent the saving of settings in certain situations.
- Plugin authors: Added new API to allow to display "drawables." These are any
  GUI widgets that you wish to display that are tied to a particular button.
  For example, drawables can be used to display a popup menu (see the
  PopupMenuDrawable class and the example source code), or an informational
  small window when hovering over a button. Drawables will always be positioned
  near the parent toolbar (much like button folders.)
  This new API is available for users of the official Toolbar wrapper as well.

1.6.1, 2014-02-28
- You can now choose different icons for folder buttons.

1.6.0, 2014-02-15
- Added support for multiple toolbars. You can add new toolbars by selecting
  "Create New Toolbar" from the triangle drop-down menu. Each toolbar has its
  own separate set of settings, folders, and visible buttons.
- The map view during flight is now considered a separate game scene. This
  means that it is now possible to configure different toolbars for the
  regular flight scene and the flight map scene.

1.5.3, 2014-02-13
- Fixed a bug where buttons marked as "important" could prevent the toolbar
  from auto-hiding itself, even though those buttons have not been configured
  to be visible.

1.5.2, 2014-02-08
- Removed the popup dialog that notifies about new buttons that became
  available. Instead, the toolbar will always show the configuration button as
  long as no other buttons are configured to be visible.
- Fixed a bug where the toolbar would lose the configured visibility of some
  buttons.
- Fixed a bug where a newly-created folder would not respect the "show border"
  setting of the main toolbar.
- Plugin authors: Added an official Toolbar Plugin wrapper that can be used to
  provide Toolbar Plugin support without creating a hard dependency. Check the
  development forum thread at http://bit.ly/1b1ZXda for details.

1.5.1, 2014-02-07
- Fixed a bug where the new buttons notification would pop up more often
  than intended.
- Fixed a bug where folders would not display their contents.
- The update notification button can now be dismissed (hidden) by right-
  clicking it.

1.5.0, 2014-02-07
- You can now configure the visibility of each button. For example, you can
  now hide a button if you don't need it. Button visibility is saved in
  relation to game scene.
  Note: This change will cause a one-time reset of the toolbar, such that
  no buttons are visible at first. Toolbar location will be preserved.

1.4.5, 2014-02-04
- Fixed another bug where the toolbar would get completely invisible under
  certain circumstances.
- Various other minor improvements and bug fixes.

1.4.4, 2014-01-27
- Fixed a bug where the toolbar would get completely invisible under certain
  circumstances.

1.4.3, 2014-01-25
- Various minor improvements and bug fixes.

1.4.2, 2014-01-13
- The plugin will now display a confirmation dialog before deleting a folder.
- The plugin will now check for incorrect installations and display a
  warning if necessary.

1.4.1, 2014-01-05
- Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause buttons to render with Unity's
  default skin instead of the KSP skin.

1.4.0, 2014-01-01
- You can now add custom folders to the toolbar, which can hold any number
  of regular buttons for improved organization.

1.3.0, 2013-12-26
- You can now reorder the buttons on the toolbar. Button order is saved in
  relation to game scene (for example, you can have a different button order
  in the flight scene and the tracking station scene.)
- Plugin authors: Added new property IButton.EffectivelyVisible. See the
  documentation of that property for details.

1.2.2, 2013-12-23
- You may now chose to use the KSP skin for buttons instead of Unity's
  default 'Smoke' skin.
- The toolbar border can now be hidden.
- Improved the positioning/sizing of the toolbar after startup with respect
  to the size that has been chosen previously by the player.

1.2.1, 2013-12-20
- Increased the size of the triangle button that opens the toolbar-specific
  drop-down menu.
- Fixed a bug that could make the toolbar completely invisible under
  certain circumstances.
- The toolbar should now no longer be visible during loading screens.
- Plugin authors: Added new events IButton.OnMouseEnter/OnMouseLeave.
  See the documentation of those events for details.

1.2.0, 2013-12-17
- Toolbar position and size are stored in relation to the current scene now.
  For example, you can place it at different positions in the vehicle assembly
  building, the spaceplane hangar, and the actual flight scene.
- Plugin authors: There is a new property IButton.Important now. See the
  documentation of that property for details.

1.1.0, 2013-12-08
- Added a new toolbar-specific drop-down menu where players can configure
  the toolbar.
- Repositioning and resizing the toolbar should now be considerably easier.
- Added the ability to auto-hide the toolbar when it is positioned at the
  screen edge.
- Plugin authors: No API changes were made in this version.

1.0.0, 2013-12-06
- Initial public release.
